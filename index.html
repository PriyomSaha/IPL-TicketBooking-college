Each season has lived up to its billing with some excellent performances from some of the sides so far. This year’s tickets are available on BookMyShow, Insider.in, TicketGenie, EventsNow, Liveinstyle and Paytm <br><br>

The IPL auction took place in January, and now we know who will be representing each team as they look to be crowned IPL Champions 2018. The 2018 edition of the Indian Premier League will see the Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals return to the fold after a two-year suspension. They will replace the Gujarat Lions and the Rising Pune Supergiant. These two returning teams make this a very interesting season, and both will be hoping to come back with a bang and challenge for the silverware.<br><br>

As normal, during the auction we saw some of the biggest names in world cricket bought by IPL franchises, and it will be great to see those players go head to head. Some will be returning to their old clubs, while others are starting new adventures with new franchises and it will be interesting to see how these players get on with new surroundings.<br><br>

Here is what we witnessed in the 10th edition. Mumbai Indians won a thrilling 2017 IPL Final by beating the Rising Pune Supergiant by a single run to lift the IPL Trophy. This came in a low-scoring game in which the Mumbai Indians scored 129 batting first and were able to restrict the Pune side for 128 in response.<br><br>

The game that was played in Hyderabad, after the previous playoffs matches were held in Mumbai and Bengaluru respectively, saw a tough pitch making it even tougher for the batsmen of the two sides. Mumbai were restricted to 129 in their 20 overs but at one stage it looked like they wouldn’t even get to 110 and in reply, the bowling efforts of Mitchell Johnson and Jasprit Bumrah kept the Steven Smith-led Pune side down to 128.<br><br>

Earlier, it was Mumbai Indians who finished the tournament league stage at the top of the points table with 20 points from 14 matches, while Pune were second with 18 points. Hyderabad and Kolkata ended third and fourth and faced each other in an Eliminator, which KKR won to make it to the second Qualifier.<br><br>

With Pune defeating Mumbai in the first Qualifier – the third time they had done that this season – it was left to Mumbai and Kolkata to fight it out for a place in the final. Mumbai easily crushed the KKR hopes to enter the final and then defeated Pune for the first time this season to lift the trophy.<br><br>

Kings XI Punjab were in with a chance to make the playoffs but for that they needed to defeat the Rising Pune Supergiant in their last league game but went down with consummate ease. Delhi Daredevils, Gujarat Lions and Royal Challengers Bangalore bowed out of the competition quite early.<br><br>

What also needs to be seen is if the BCCI agrees to add an extra couple of teams to make it a 10-team tournament, but that wouldn’t mean a direct entry to the Lions and Supergiant – instead, they will need to file for a separate process to buy into the two teams.
